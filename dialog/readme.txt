Here are some DTD (aka *.dtd) - Document Type Definition from https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/tree/master/xmlscript/dtd
Seems like referencing from web does not work for Eclipse.
These DTD help to validate Dialog xmls like TranslationDialog.xdl for Extension because it has some custom xml elements. 
This is not mandatory, but it is somewhat pretty that errors in Eclipse are not showing missing entities.
